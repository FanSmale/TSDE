-----Usage-----
Find a (possibly) minimal test reducts of the decision system using a heuristic algorithm.

-----Input-----
Weighting mode: Unweighting - using information gain directly. Weighting - using weighted information gain.
Delta upper bound: The upper bound of the Delta value. There are different settings of delta, such that we get to know which setting is the best.
Delta lower bound: See the upper bound.
Delta step length: In conjunction with lower and upper bounds.
Number of experiments: Decide different test cost settings. This is equivalently to dealing with a number of different datasets.
