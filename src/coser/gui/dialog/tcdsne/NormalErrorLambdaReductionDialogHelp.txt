-----Usage-----
Find a (possibly) minimal test reducts of the decision system using a heuristic algorithm.

-----Input-----
Weighting mode: Unweighting - using information gain directly. Weighting - using weighted information gain.
Lambda upper bound: The upper bound of the Lambda value. There are different settings of lambda, such that we get to know which setting is the best.
Lambda lower bound: See the upper bound.
Lambda step length: In conjunction with lower and upper bounds.
Number of experiments: Decide different test cost settings. This is equivalently to dealing with a number of different datasets.
