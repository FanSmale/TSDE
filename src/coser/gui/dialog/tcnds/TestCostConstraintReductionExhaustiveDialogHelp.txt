-----Usage-----
Find optimal partial reducts of the decision system using exhaustive algorithms.

-----Input-----
The algorithm.
  SESRA and SESRA are employed in \cite{MinZhu11Optimal}
  BASS is employed in \cite{MinZhu11OptimalDynamic}
  Backtrack is employed in \cite{MinHuZhu12Feature}
The consistency metric.
The budget factor.
  Should be within (0, 1)
The number of experiments.

Attention:
When the algorithm is BASS, the consistency metric is always ENTROPY.
When the algorithm is BACKTRACK, the consistency metric is always POS.
The Backtrack algorithm only obtain one optimal subreduct.
This is why sometimes the results of different approaches are not the same.
