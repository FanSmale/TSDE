-----Usage-----
Find a (possibly) minimal test cost reduct of the decision system using the ant colony optimization

-----Input-----
Ant counts lower bound: the lower bound of the number of ants in an ant colony
Ant counts upper bound: the upper bound of the number of ants in an ant colony
Ant counts increment: the increment of the number of ants in an ant colony
Alpha lower bound: the lower bound of the alpha
Alpha upper bound: the upper bound of the alpha
Alpha increment: the increment of the alpha
Appointed alpha: the fix alpha value
Experiment counts: the number of experiments
